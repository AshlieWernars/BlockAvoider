# BlockAvoider
The first Java 2D Game I made, called Block Avoider.<br />
The project is based upon a Youtube tutorial series from RealTutsGML [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWms45O3n--6TvZmtFHaCWRZwEqnz2MHa).<br />
It has ofcourse been modified to my liking (Added extra difficulties and improved perfomance + bug fixes)<br />
The project was originally made in the summer of 2020, but has been constantly updated over the last (Almost) 4 Years, And has now been made public for anyone to play! :)<br />

Its made with Java 17.0.10 in Eclipse 2024-03, no extra libraries required. <br />
Tested on Linux Mint and Windows 10.<br />
