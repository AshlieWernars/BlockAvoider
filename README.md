# BlockAvoider
The first Java 2D Game I made, called Block Avoider.
The project is based upon a Youtube tutorial series from RealTutsGML (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWms45O3n--6TvZmtFHaCWRZwEqnz2MHa).
It has ofcourse been modified to my liking (Added extra difficulties and improved perfomance + bug fixes)
The project was originally made in the summer of 2020, but has been constantly updated over the last (Almost) 4 Years, And has now been made public for anyone to play! :)

Its made with Java 17.0.10 in Eclipse 2024-03, no extra libraries required. Tested on Linux Mint and Windows 10.
