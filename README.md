# BlockAvoider
The first Java 2D Game I made, called Block Avoider.<br />
The project is based upon a Youtube tutorial series from [RealTutsGML](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWms45O3n--6TvZmtFHaCWRZwEqnz2MHa).<br />
I have added extra difficulties and improved the overall perfomance<br />
The project was made in the summer of 2020, and has been constantly updated over the last years.<br />
The game has now been made public for anyone to play! :)<br />

Made with:<br />
Java 17.0.10<br />
Eclipse 2024-03<br />

Tested on Linux Mint and Windows 10.<br />
